Amsterdam-Colors

I built Amsterdam-Colors during the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly.

Amsterdam-Colors uses the collection at the Dutch National Museum in Amsterdam to help designers coordinate colors palettes for personal projects.

After signing in, a user picks a main color, the site then retrieves images from the Dutch National Museum that use this main color. The user can browse images and, if he or she likes the color scheme of a particular image, the user may choose an image to save in his or her personal gallery.

Images saved to the user’s personal gallery give hex codes for six or seven of the main colors used in the work. This allows the user to incorporate the artist’s color scheme in the user’s personal projects.

The finished site is available at https://amsterdam-colors.herokuapp.com
